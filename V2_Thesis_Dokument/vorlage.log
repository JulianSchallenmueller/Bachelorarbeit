Class scrbook Warning: \float@addtolists detected!
(scrbook)              Implementation of \float@addtolist became
(scrbook)              deprecated in KOMA-Script v3.01 2008/11/14 and
(scrbook)              has been replaced by several more flexible
(scrbook)              features of package `tocbasic`.
(scrbook)              Since Version 3.12 support for deprecated
(scrbook)              \float@addtolist interface has been
(scrbook)              restricted to only some of the KOMA-Script
(scrbook)              features and been removed from others.
(scrbook)              Loading of package `scrhack' may help to
(scrbook)              avoid this warning, if you are using a
(scrbook)              a package that still implements the
