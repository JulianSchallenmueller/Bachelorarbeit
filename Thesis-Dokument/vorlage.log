Package scrlayer-scrpage Warning: \headheight to low.
(scrlayer-scrpage)                At least 16.31995pt needed,
(scrlayer-scrpage)                but only 15.95009pt found.
(scrlayer-scrpage)                I'll enlarge \headheight, for further
(scrlayer-scrpage)                processing, but you should do this yourself,
(scrlayer-scrpage)                e.g., setting typearea's option
(scrlayer-scrpage)                `headheight=16.31995pt'.
(scrlayer-scrpage)                I'll also decrease \topmargin on input line 13.

Class scrbook Warning: \float@addtolists detected!
(scrbook)              Implementation of \float@addtolist became
(scrbook)              deprecated in KOMA-Script v3.01 2008/11/14 and

(scrbook)              Since Version 3.12 support for deprecated

(scrbook)              features and been removed from others.
(scrbook)              Loading of package `scrhack' may help to
